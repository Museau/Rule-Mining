# Rule-Mining

This repository contains the code used for the experiments of the paper "[Rule-Mining based classification: a benchmark study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.10199.pdf)".

## Launch the experiments
To launch the experiments do: `bash rule_mining/experiments/jobs/file_name.py`, from the Rule-Mining directory.

## Visualization
To do the visualisation and get some statistics for the rules do:
- `pyhton rule_mining/visualisation/figures_rules.py`,
- `python rule_mining/visualisation/rule_characteristics_pervar_perclass.py`,
- `python rule_mining/visualisation/scores_var_by_level.py`,
- `python rule_mining/visualisation/similarity_main_all.py`,
- `python rule_mining/visualisation/similarity_main_l1.py`,
from the Rule-Mining directory.
